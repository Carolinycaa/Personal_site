        <h3 id="Headline">Here is a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1815</strong> - Born in England on December 10</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1832</strong> - Ada met mathematician and inventor Charles
            Babbage at a town party. She was fascinated by his Difference
            Engine, an early version of the calculator. He soon became her
            mentor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1833</strong> - her mathematical talents led her to a long
            working relationship and friendship with fellow British
            mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of
            computers".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1835</strong> - Ada married William King, who became the
            Earl of Lovelace three years later, making her the Countess of
            Lovelace. They had three children, and even though most wives and
            mothers of the time worked only in the home, Ada Lovelace continued
            her work with Babbage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1840</strong> - Lovelace began a gambling habit that
            contributed to her dwindling finances and forced her to secretly
            pawn the Lovelace family’s diamonds
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1843</strong> - Babbage was developing the Analytical
            Engine, a more complicated version of the Difference Engine. He
            asked Lovelace to translate French text from his engineer into
            English. Lovelace not only translated the notes but added her own,
            signing them “A.A.L.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1844</strong> - She commented to a friend Woronzow Greig
            about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain
            gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1852</strong> - Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27
            November from uterine cancer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1979</strong> - The U.S. Department of Defense named a new
            computer language “Ada” in her honor. Because of her advanced way of
            thinking, she’s often considered the first computer programmer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1981</strong> - the Association for Women in Computing
            inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award.
          </li>

            Ada Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday
            of October,[113] which began in 2009.[114] Its goal is to "... raise
            the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and
            maths," and to "create new role models for girls and women" in these
            fields.
